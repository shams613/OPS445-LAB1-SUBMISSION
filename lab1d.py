'''Description: This program demonstrates math operations in Python.'''
# Any line that starts with a "#" is also known as a comment,
# these lines are ignored by the python interpreter even if
# they contain code. The very first line is called a Shebang line, 
# it is used to tell the system which interpreter to 
# use(python2, python3, bash, etc). 
# Create objects for x, y, and z
x = 10
y = 2
z = 5

# Perform a mathematical operation and print the result
print(f'{x} + {y} * {z} = {x + y * z}')
