'''Description: This program tells Isaac's age.'''
# Any line that starts with a "#" is also known as a comment,
# these lines are ignored by the python interpreter even if
# they contain code. The very first line is called a Shebang line, 
# it is used to tell the system which interpreter to 
# use(python2, python3, bash, etc).
# Create objects for name and age
name = 'Isaac'
age = 72

# Print the message to the screen
print(name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old!')
