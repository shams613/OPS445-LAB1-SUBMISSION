'''Description: This program asks how old Isaac is.'''
# Any line that starts with a "#" is also known as a comment,
# these lines are ignored by the python interpreter even if
# they contain code. The very first line is called a Shebang line, 
# it is used to tell the system which interpreter to 
# use(python2, python3, bash, etc). 

# Create a string object
name = 'Isaac'

# Print the question to the screen
print('How old are you ' + name + '?')
